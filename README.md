Users can register with the system by sending a text message ("register charlie") to a registration number.
This ties an alias of the user's choice to the phone number.

Users can author libs and choose a set of existing players to fill in the blanks. Those players will
receive text messages prompting them for responses. Once all fields have been filled, a result text will be
sent to all participants and the author.
